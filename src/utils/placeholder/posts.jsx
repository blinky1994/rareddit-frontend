      title : `Hi guys, I made this website using React.`,
      content : `This was an earlier project that I had to learn some frontend by mimicking a real website. I originally planned to create a full stack application by connecting the posts and comments to a database but due to time constraints and other projects that were more important at this point in time, I'm leaving it as a frontend demo, thanks for checking it out. You can actually create a new post but since it's stored on the frontend, your posts will be gone. Upvote and downvote feature works too but likewise, it's not stored permanently. Search function and post interaction buttons (Comment / Award / Share) does not work and is just a UI demo.`,

What language do you recommend starting off learning that you could get a job with after a year? Any tips or reccmondations would be greatly appreciated`,
