      content : `So to dive right in, I live in New Jersey... and a year ago I came across that we had legalized recreational marijuana sales across the entire state. At the time, I was a 21 year old kid looking to start my first business, and figured why not dive into something I'm quite familiar with.
      Process went relatively smooth, I needed to submit an application for a state license as the first step. This included a ton of sweat equity into building a business plan, operational plans, security plans, financial projections, etc. That I needed to present to the state to let them know I'm fully aware of the proper business operations and give a sense of safety that they'd be giving a license to someone who 1. knows what they're doing... 2. Understands the safety precautions needed with such a business... 3. was aware of the special ways cannabis businesses are taxed and monitored.
      With me being a 22 year old broke college student, I did all of this on my own and without the help of anyone (other than my lawyer for all legal documents and some strategy). So ultimately, throughout this entire process, I ended up spending around $4,000 and 6 months of my time.`,
